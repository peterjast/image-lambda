# image-lambda

## description of how to use lambda

When you add images to the S3 bucket my-test-image-bucket, the lamda function is triggered by the event and gets the images.json file.

## description of any issues encountered during deployment of this lambda

I was encountering Type Errors that made it so I was creating an images.json file, but it was empty.
